/// The regression this guards: `doctor` used to probe `[dependencies] system`
/// entries with `which()`, treating packages as if they were tools. That
/// misreports in both directions — a binary-less package like aspell-en (a
/// dictionary) showed as missing even when installed, and any binary that
/// happens to share a package's name showed as installed without the package
/// being on. The probe must go through the package manager, the same one
/// `tools install-deps` uses.
///
/// The test plants a fake binary on PATH whose name is not a real package.
/// The old which()-based doctor reported it ok; the package-manager probe
/// must report it missing. This assumes a supported package manager exists
/// (dpkg/rpm/pacman/brew) — on a machine without one, `install-deps` bails
/// anyway, so that environment is already unsupported.
