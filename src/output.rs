//! The single sink for human-readable output.
//!
//! Before this module, `--json` purity was maintained by remembering to
//! guard each of ~445 `println!` sites by hand. The guard was present at 12
//! of them. That is not a contract, it is a habit — and it had already
//! failed: plain `--json` leaked build-phase lines, and `--color=always`
//! put raw ANSI escapes on stdout.
//!
//! Everything human-facing on the build path goes through [`info`] /
//! [`detail`] / [`warn`] / [`error`], which consult the same predicate in
//! one place. Machine-readable output (`--json` events, and the JSON bodies
//! that command handlers print) goes to stdout directly and is never
//! suppressed — it *is* the output in that mode.
//!
//! ## Which stream
//!
//! - [`info`] and [`detail`] write to **stdout**: they are the program's
//!   answer to what the user asked.
//! - [`warn`] and [`error`] write to **stderr**: they must remain visible
//!   when stdout is being consumed as data, and must never interleave into
//!   a JSON stream.
//!
//! Command handlers that print a JSON document under `--json` still branch
//! on [`crate::json_output::is_json_mode`] and call `println!` for the
//! document itself. That is correct — the document is the machine output.
