# Cache System

RSConstruct uses a content-addressed cache to enable fast incremental builds. This page describes the cache architecture, storage format, and rebuild logic.

## Overview

The cache lives in `.rsconstruct/` and consists of:

- `objects/` — content-addressed blob store, sharded by the first two hex
  characters of the content hash
- `descriptors/` — cache descriptors (marker/blob/tree JSON), sharded the
  same way but addressed by the descriptor key rather than by content
- `db.redb` — redb database holding the `processor_configs` table used for
  config-change diffing
- `deps.redb` — source file dependency cache (see [Dependency Caching](dependency-caching.md))
- `mtime.redb` — mtime→checksum pre-check cache that lets unchanged files
  skip re-hashing
- `webcache.redb` — HTTP request cache for processors that fetch remote
  resources

## Data model

The object store contains three kinds of objects, inspired by git:

### Blobs

A blob is a file's raw content, addressed by its SHA-256 content hash. Blobs are optionally zstd-compressed and made read-only to prevent corruption when restored via hardlinks.

Blobs are stored content-addressed — two products producing identical output share the same blob. This enables deduplication and hardlink-based restoration.

### Why blobs don't store output paths

A blob is pure content — it has no knowledge of where it will be restored. This is critical for two reasons:

1. **Rename survival.** If you rename `foo.md` to `bar.md` without changing its content, the cache key (which is content-addressed) is the same. The blob is reused and restored to the new output path (`bar.txt` instead of `foo.txt`). If the blob stored its output path, this wouldn't work.

2. **Deduplication across trees.** Multiple tree entries can point to the same blob under different paths. For example, if two files in a creator's output have identical content, they share the same blob object in the store. The tree records the path; the blob just holds the content.

### Trees

A tree is a serialized list of `(path, mode, blob_checksum)` entries describing a set of output files. Trees are stored as descriptors under `descriptors/`, addressed by the descriptor key (not by content hash). A tree maps relative file paths to content-addressed blobs. Multiple trees can point to the same blobs — deduplication happens at the blob level.

### Markers

A marker is a minimal descriptor indicating that a check passed. Markers are stored under `descriptors/`, addressed by the descriptor key, and reference no blobs.

### Cache entries

A cache entry is a small JSON descriptor stored under `.rsconstruct/descriptors/` at the path derived from the descriptor key. It contains:

```json
{"type": "blob", "checksum": "abc123...", "mode": 493}
```

Note: the blob descriptor has no path — the product knows where its output goes.

Or:

```json
{"type": "tree", "entries": [{"path": "dir/file.txt", "checksum": "def456...", "mode": 493}]}
```

or:

```json
{"type": "marker"}
```

The actual file content lives in separate content-addressed blob objects. The cache entry is just a pointer (for generators) or a manifest (for creators).

### On-disk layout

```
.rsconstruct/objects/
  a1/b2c3d4...    # blob (raw file content), addressed by content hash
  cd/ef5678...    # another blob (".zst" suffix when compressed)
.rsconstruct/descriptors/
  ff/0011aa...    # descriptor (JSON), addressed by descriptor key
```

Descriptors and blobs live in separate directories with the same two-hex-char
sharding. Keeping them separate is what lets `cache trim` delete unreferenced
blobs by scanning the descriptors.

## Cache keys

The descriptor key identifies a product build. It is computed as
(`CacheKey::descriptor_key` in `src/cache_key.rs`):

```
hash(processor_name, processor_version, cache_key_digest, input_content_hash)
```

Where:
- `processor_name` — the processor type (e.g., `pandoc`, `ruff`)
- `processor_version` — the processor's cache version from the plugin
  registry; bumping it invalidates every entry the processor ever produced
  (see [Processor versioning](processor-versioning.md))
- `cache_key_digest` — a digest of every piece of **non-input** state that
  affects the output (below)
- `input_content_hash` — combined SHA-256 hash of all input file contents

The key is **content-addressed**: it depends on what the inputs contain, not what they're named. Renaming a file without changing its content produces the same cache key.

### Cache key components

`CacheKey` is the single owner of key composition. Key material used to be
assembled in five uncoordinated places, all splicing into one opaque
`config_hash: Option<String>` with three different separator conventions —
so a component that silently failed to be mixed in was invisible, and a
changed key could not be attributed to a cause. Contributors now append a
named, typed component and one function folds them into the digest:

| Component | Contributed by | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `config` | discovery, via `output_config_hash` over the processor's `checksum_fields()` | compiler flags, args, output declarations |
| `variant` | `Product::with_variant` | multiple products from one input (e.g. one per output format) |
| `analyzer` | `Product::extend_config_hash` | non-content state an analyzer resolves, e.g. the sorted set of paths matching a glob |
| `tool` | `apply_tool_version_hashes`, gated on [`hash_tool_versions`](../configuration.md#build) | identity of the external tools the processor invokes |

The component *kind* is part of the digest, so a `config` value and a `tool`
value that happen to be equal do not collide. Order is significant and
deterministic (discovery, then analyzers, then tool versions).

`rsconstruct product show <path>` prints the components individually, so any
descriptor-key change is attributable to exactly one of them (or to
`input_checksum`).

### Multi-format processors

For processors that produce multiple output formats from the same input (e.g., pandoc producing PDF, HTML, and DOCX), each format is a separate product with a separate cache key. The output format is mixed into the key as the `variant` component, so each format gets its own key naturally.

### Output depends on input name (known limitation)

Most processors produce output that depends only on input content. However, a processor that embeds the input filename in its output (e.g., a `// Generated from foo.c` header) can get a false cache hit when a file is renamed without a content change, because the descriptor key hashes input *content*, not input *path*. A per-processor `output_depends_on_input_name` opt-in is planned but not implemented (see `todo.md`). A rename with identical content is a cache hit by design (the blob is path-free and is restored to the product's current output path — see the `cache_survives_input_rename` test), which is exactly why a filename-embedding processor would restore output still mentioning the old name.

## Flows

### Lookup

1. Compute the cache key from processor name + config + input contents
2. Look up the object at that key in the object store
3. If not found: cache miss, product must be built
4. If found: read the descriptor, act based on type

### Cache (after successful build)

**Checker:**
1. Store a `{"type": "marker"}` entry at the cache key

**Generator (single output):**
1. Store the output file content as a content-addressed blob
2. Store a `{"type": "blob", "checksum": "..."}` entry at the cache key

**Creator (multiple outputs):**
1. Walk all output directories and files
2. Store each file as a content-addressed blob
3. Build the tree entries: `[{"path": "...", "checksum": "...", "mode": ...}, ...]`
4. Store a `{"type": "tree", "entries": [...]}` entry at the cache key

### Restore

**Checker:** Nothing to restore. Cache entry exists = check passed.

**Generator:**
1. Read the cache entry, get the blob checksum
2. Hardlink or copy the blob to the output path

**Creator:**
1. Read the cache entry, get the tree entries
2. For each `(path, checksum, mode)`: restore the blob to the path, set permissions

### Skip

If the cache entry exists AND all output files are present on disk, no work is needed.

## Rebuild classification

| Classification | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Skip** | Cache key found AND all outputs exist on disk | No work needed |
| **Restore** | Cache key found BUT some outputs are missing | Restore from object store |
| **Build** | No cache entry for this key | Execute the processor |

Because the cache key incorporates input content, a changed input produces a different key. There's no "stale entry" — either the key exists or it doesn't.

### Stale outputs before a rebuild

Cache objects are read-only and a hardlink restore shares their inode, so a restored output cannot be overwritten in place by the tool that regenerates it. Before a product is built or restored, the files of its previous tree are unlinked. That tree cannot be found through the current key (the input changed, so the key did too): the `product_last_tree` table in `db.redb` maps a product's *owner key* — processor instance, primary input and output paths, nothing that changes with content or config — to the descriptor it last built or restored. Outputs left by an rsconstruct older than that table are recognised by the restore's own signature instead: read-only files with a link count above one.

## Config-aware caching

Processor configuration is hashed into cache keys. Changing a config value triggers rebuilds even if source files haven't changed.

## Cache restoration methods

| Method | Behavior | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `hardlink` | Links output to cached blob (same inode, read-only) | Local development (fast, no disk space) |
| `copy` | Copies cached blob to output path (writable) | CI runners, cross-filesystem setups |
| `auto` (default) | Uses `copy` when `CI=true`, `hardlink` otherwise | Most setups |

Hardlinks work because blob objects contain raw file content (not wrapped in a descriptor). Only cache entries (which point to blobs) contain JSON metadata.

## Cache commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `rsconstruct cache size` | Show cache size and object count |
| `rsconstruct cache list` | List all cache entries as JSON |
| `rsconstruct cache stats` | Show per-processor cache statistics |
| `rsconstruct cache trim` | Remove unreferenced objects |
| `rsconstruct cache clear` | Delete the entire cache |

## Clean vs Clear

**`rsconstruct clean`** removes build outputs but preserves the cache:

- **Generators**: Output files deleted. Next build restores via hardlink/copy.
- **Checkers**: Nothing to delete. Next build skips.
- **Creators**: Output directories deleted. Next build restores from tree.

**`rsconstruct cache clear`** wipes everything — descriptors and blobs. A cleared cache means "forget everything, rebuild from scratch." The entire `.rsconstruct/` directory is removed, which also takes the auxiliary caches (`mtime.redb`, `deps.redb`, `webcache.redb`) with it. If only blobs were cleared but descriptors survived, the cache would think outputs are available but fail to restore them. Clearing both together avoids this inconsistency.

## Incremental rebuild after partial failure

Each product is cached independently after successful execution. If a build fails partway through, the next run only rebuilds products without valid cache entries.

## Remote caching

See [Remote Caching](../remote-caching.md) for sharing cache between machines and CI.
